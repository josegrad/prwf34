The good news is that Wonder Woman is getting a calendar again after having missed last year. 

You’ll note that it is not the new costume. Pre-order here
There is also a Dark Knight Rises calendar which I would hope would have Catwoman in it.

Marvel is doing its “Women of Marvel” calendar but it looks like DC maybe skipping theirs again this year. Perhaps there will be 12 month version.
