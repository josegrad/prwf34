First, for those who speculated that Batman was Dick Grayson due to the use of Escrima sticks it looks like you’re wrong because Batman is definitely Helena’s dad and definitely a “Wayne”:

“Who will Batman kill to save his own daughter?” asks EARTH 2 editor Pat  McCallum. “Right out of the gate that should tell you we’re dealing  with a different kind of Dark Knight here. More ruthless, dangerous…the  costume is familiar and yeah, there is a Wayne under the mask, but we’re  looking at a man desperate to save the only family he has left. EARTH 2  is about to become a very bad place to be a bad guy.”

So far Earth 2 sounds very grim and gritty. That said there are going to be, I believe, some nice surprises in terms of the characters on Earth 2. I don’t believe, however, that includes Wally and Donna.
