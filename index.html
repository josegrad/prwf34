<p>Today would have been martial artist Bruce Lee’s 71st<strike>0th</strike>* birthday. In  the 60s and early 70s, Lee was almost single handily responsible for the  rise in popularity of martial arts. In addition to appearing as Kato in  <em>Green Hornet</em> TV show (including a cross-over with <em>Batman</em>), he was the inspiration for Caine in <em>Kung-Fu</em> (instead the character was whitecast with David Carradine). But Lee was  most famous for the series of Kung-Fu films he did. But did you also  know that Bruce is also connected to some of the most fierce female  fighters in the DCU?</p>
<p>I’m able to make this statement because of this book:</p>
<p><img src="tumblr_lck92qBoLd1qbujox.jpg"></p>
<p>This series by Denny O’Neill had Richard Dragon facing off against a top martial artist. A man so good he was known as the:</p>
<p><img src="tumblr_lck946VRMO1qbujox.jpg"></p>
<p>So Richard Dragon honed his skills against a man trained by Lee. And, of course, Dragon then went on to train:</p>
<p><img src="tumblr_lck99mldj81qbujox.jpg"></p>
<p>Helena Bertinelli, the Huntress (in<em> Cry for Blood</em>).</p>
<p><img src="tumblr_lck9a0urvw1qbujox.jpg"></p>
<p>Oracle (in <em>Oracle: Year One</em>).</p>
<p><img src="tumblr_lck9aiqj081qbujox.jpg"></p>
<p>Renee Montoya (in <em>52</em>).</p>
<p>Dragon also trained Vic Sage, the Question. Dragon also fought (in a  series by Chuck Dixon <strike>which is may not be canon</strike>) Lady Shiva.</p>
<p><img src="tumblr_lck9cxUrLt1qbujox.jpg"></p>
<p>Bruce Lee is also responsible for the introductions of Misty Knight and Colleen Wing who first appeared in the pages of <em>The Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu</em> series published by Marvel to cash in on the popularity of Lee.</p>
<p><img src="tumblr_lcka1tGV411qbujox.jpg"></p>
<p>So if you like ass kicking DC (and Marvel) women, take a minute today to think of Bruce Lee!</p>

<p>The pictures from Empire magazine are now online and Bale has stated in an interview he is done as the Dark Knight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christian announced that this could be his last time as the masked  vigilante whose secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American billionaire  who as a child witnessed his parents’ murder, leading him to a life of  revenge on crime. “I wrapped a few days ago so that will be the last  time I’m taking that cowl [Batman hood] off,” he said. “I believe that  the whole production wrapped yesterday, so it’s all done. Everything’s  finished. It’s me and Chris – that will be the end of that Batman era.”</p>

<p>Today is Noel Neill’s 91st birthday. Neill played Lois Lane in the movies and later television. She also appeared in <em>Superman: The Movie</em> as the mother of a young Lois Lane.</p>
<p>Until the Superman movie came along in 1978, she was the live action Lois for most fans (although Phyllis Coates who Neill replace on the television show has her fans).</p>
<p>Neill played Lois as an aggressive, smart reporter and there was always just a bit of dryness in her scenes with George Reeves.</p>
<p>So happy birthday Noel!</p>

<p><img align="left" height="198" src="tumblr_lv43fcwDgB1qbujox.jpg" width="140">Tomorrow is the day when the people of my country stuff themselves with pie, watch football, and give thanks.</p>
<p>Last year I did a list of comic “Turkeys” and a list of things I was thankful for in the world of comics. This year in the spirit of the season I decided to pass on enumerating the jaw droppingly bad stuff and focus on the good things. For the most part.</p>
<p>Here is an admittedly eclectic, rambling list of some of the things I am thankful in comics this year.</p>
<p><strong><img align="left" height="250" src="tumblr_lv43pbEIxh1qbujox.jpg" width="177">Batwoman.</strong> It took so long to get here, but it was well worth the wait. Smart, gorgeous to look at and lucky enough to have had two wonderful creative teams with synergy between the first and the second, <em>Batwoman</em> right now is everything I want from a superhero comic with a female lead. I spoke with J.H. Williams III last night and after hearing what he had to say about the book, I am feeling confident it will be for a while. That the lead in this best-selling book is the first opening gay woman to headline an ongoing comic? Double thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Snyder.</strong> It’s not just that he’s a great comic book writer (because he is). It’s because with his run on <em>Detective</em> this year he reminded me of so many things I love about comics. First his work on issue # 875 gave me the jolt of what it is feels like when you read a truly great and memorable issue of a comic. Second, because of how he conveys how Gotham City is as an important character in the Bat-Mythos. Third, how he returned Cass Cain to the Batfamily in <em>Gates of Gotham</em>. And finally, the thrill of coming across a writer who you may have only been dimly aware of and then realizing the weren’t just good, they were so good you were going to follow them as a writer for the rest of your life. Thanks Scott.</p>
<p><strong><img align="left" src="tumblr_lv43sqXSyv1qbujox.jpg">Womanathology</strong>. Female creators and comics. There was lots of debate and lots of stories written this year that talked about the number of female creators or lack there of especially in superhero comics. (Let’s put it this way when I thought about a Turkey list the first item was titled “Who should I have hired?”) But with all the debate going on Renae De Liz decided to that showing is sometimes the best way to get a point across and put together a comic anthology consisting of all female creators. That in itself isn’t particularly new or different. What was different was that by using Kickstarter to fund it she was able to spotlight the demand of female created comics at a time when the debate was in full swing. The project blew past its initial funding goals and went from just a project to be funded into a crystallizing moment. If you haven’t ordered a copy yet, I can’t think of a better comic item to invest in this year. If you have some extra cash please order a copy of this book and send a message that you support female comic creators (and also help support charity).</p>
<p><strong>Geek Girl Con. </strong>Another grass roots effort around women and comics or really all things<img align="right" src="tumblr_lv43vh92pm1qbujox.jpg"> Geek. While I’m used to the debate about female comic readers (and by used to it I mean practically engrained in my DNA after this year) it was shocking to me that in the 21st century there was actually a debate about women being “true” geeks vs. “fake” geeks. The sad part was this debate actually had some women pissing on their own gender to try in some kind of effort to prove their real “geek” cred. Ugh.</p>
<p>But the wonderful women of Geek Girl Con decided to not just talk about the power of Girl Geeks but show it off. And so some smart women put on the first of its kind conference that was all about women and geek stuff. The response was great. The show sold out and the feedback from the attendees including creators was incredibly positive. Congrats to the organizers. And also congratulations to <em>The Mary Sue</em> who launched this year as a site devoted to women and geeky things.</p>
<p><strong>Kyrax2</strong>. You can talk about the problems with female characters. You can write about the way they are treated. You can tell the powers to be how concerning it is. And while there may be some response, sometimes you need to move the dialogue to a higher level. And so I am thankful that a woman named Kyrax put on a Batgirl costume and decided to go ask some of these questions in person at SDCC. And the combination of the questions and their responses created yet another crystallizing moment this year for women in comics. The result of the showdown at SDCC was painful, controversial, divisive. But it got results and the debate about women and superhero comics will never be the same. But I would be remiss if I didn’t also mention the many other women who also have been fighting the good fight this year like Heidi McDonald, Laura Hudson, Ragnell, Maddy, Kelly Thompson, Corinna Lawson, Alexa Dickman,  Esther Inglis-Arkell, Erika Peterman and Vanessa Gabriel, Soranga, Jill Pantozzi and others. And I’d like to also thank Tim Hanley who takes time each month at Bleeding Cool to give us a snapshot of the gender balance among creators at the big two despite the comments.</p>
<p>Oh and hey DC thanks for Nicola Scott on JSA and Superman and Ann Nocenti on Green Arrow!</p>
<p><strong><img align="left" height="136" src="tumblr_lv43y65w2J1qbujox.jpg" width="279">All the Batgirls</strong>. In a year where the statement “every one of the former Robins” brought up concerns about the treatment of female characters in the DC reboot, Franco and Art Bathazar and Sholly Fisch of the Johnny DC line gave us a wonderful world where all the Batgirls and and the Robins, both boy and girl, can exist together. That only everyone at DC could share that view.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Distribution</strong>. Every Wednesday at 2PM, I can now read new comics no matter where I am. DC Comics went digital this year and the world didn’t fall apart. Next year Marvel joins in. I hope this brings in a new set of readers to fuel the market even more.</p>
<p><strong><img align="left" height="131" src="tumblr_lv444ndkVh1qbujox.jpg" width="196">Miles Morales.</strong> In a year where at times I wanted to bang my head against a wall about how comics handle diversity, there is now a non-white Spider-Man. So thanks Marvel. And thanks DC for bringing back Ryan Choi and having Batwing, Static Shock, Mr. Terrific and Blue Beetle titles in your new 52 (we still need to talk about WoC). Thank you for giving kids who aren’t white a superhero that looks like them.</p>
<p><strong>Great Writers.</strong> Creators that give me great female characters in superhero comics always have my thanks. So thank you for your work this year Bryan Q. Miller, Gail Simone, Greg Rucka, Marjorie Liu, Kathryn Immonen, G. Willow Wilson, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Paul Cornell, J.H. Williams III/Haden Blackman and others, who I am sure I will think of as soon as I hit post, for the work you do.</p>
<p><strong>Kate Beaton.</strong> What can I say that will top reading this? Or this? Okay, I give you sexy Batman (with sexy, but not apparently dirty, Catwoman)</p>
<p><img src="tumblr_lv4b1uF9Zv1qbujox.png"></p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>Artists who get it when it comes to female characters. </strong>Thanks Nicola Scott, J.H. Williams III, Emma Rios, Cliff Chiang, Pere Perez, Dustin Nguyen, Phil Noto, Francesco Francavilla, Jesus Saiz, Marcus To, Francis Manapul, Mikel Janin, and Amy Reeder to name just a few, for understanding.</p>
<p><strong>You!</strong> I am truly thankful that there are so many people share the passion I have for great female characters and a vision where everyone can have an equal seat at the superhero comic table. Thanks for reading, commenting, Tweeting, sending your wonderful pictures into Girls Love Superheroes and Women Read Comics, for voting in the kick ass contest and listening to the podcast.</p>
<p>So I wish you and yours a healthy day and much good pie. What are you thankful for?</p>

<p>I can’t let this day go by without note. Cheers to Kim Yale who decided that whatever DC did to Barbara Gordon could be made into a story of hope and triumph.</p>
<p>Yale, with her husband John Ostrander created the role of Oracle for Barbara Gordon in <em>Suicide Squad</em> after the character was shot in <em>The Killing Joke.</em> They later told her year the story of her transformation in the <em>Batman Chronicles’ Oracle:Year of Hope</em>. Barbara Randall Kesel told me in an interview earlier this year that “Kim was passionate about Barbara not sitting on the sidelines. …Kim took Barbara’s (the fictional one) situation very seriously and worked tirelessly to promote Barbara’s rehabilitation.”</p>
<p>Kim’s  contributions to comics were noted when the Friends of Lulu award for  Best Newcomer was named after her. Devin Grayson and Kate Beaton are  among its recipients.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday, Kim and thanks.</p>

<p>Empire Magazine has put up some of their story from the multi-cover issues I posted earlier. And one quote from Chistopher Nolan stands out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s really all about finishing Batman and  Bruce Wayne’s story. We left him in a very precarious place. Perhaps  surprisingly for some people, our story picks up quite a bit later, <strong> eight years after The Dark Knight.</strong> So he’s an older Bruce Wayne; he’s  not in a great state.</p>

<p>Also the teaser trailer set to debut next month is basically the first 8 minutes of the movie and focuses on Bane.</p>
<p>Eight years? That’s a surprise.</p>

<p>Visitors to DC Comics’ New York offices have long been greeted when the step off the elevator by a mural showing off their large cast of superheroes. Each character was is based on the drawing of the character by one of DC’s top artists and in many cases by the artist who was most associated with them. The mural is a reproduction of a piece known as  “DC Jam” produced for the book <em>The History of the DC Universe.</em></p>
<p><img src="tumblr_lvbmgxevSQ1qbujox.jpg"></p>
<p>You can embiggen here.</p>
<p>The trinity has an all-star artist line-up - Wonder Woman by George Perez; Batman by Bob Kane; Superman by Curt Swan.</p>
<p>But now it appears there will be a new mural in the offices and this one will feature the new 52 characters in their new costumes.</p>
<p>On Adam Hughes’ web site he has for sale the drawing he did of Wonder Woman for the new mural - the first time we’ve seen Hughes who did most of the covers for Wonder Woman from 1998-2003 draw Diana in her new costume.</p>
<p><img src="tumblr_lvbm7fH5n51qbujox.jpg"></p>
<p>The website states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an illustration of the re-design of Wonder Woman for DC’s “New  52” by Adam Hughes. DC requested that Adam create this piece so that it  could be featured in a large, multi-character mural at the new DC  offices. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(It’s for sale for $8000 if you want it).</p>
<p>Will the new mural be a replacement or addition? I’ll let you know!</p>

<p>Will the Batbooks soon have their first post reboot cross-over event? Maybe. According to the Source today, the current “Court of Owls” storyline in Batman will also impact other Batbooks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And over in the BATMAN titles, the aforementioned and prolific Mr. Scott  Snyder has crafted a tale involving the Court of Owls and its deadly  Talon assassins that may soon impact the storylines in NIGHTWING,  BATGIRL, BIRDS OF PREY and even RED HOOD AND THE OUTLAWS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is very interesting. First, look at the titles involved. While Jason Todd’s book is mentioned, Tim Drake’s is not. (Neither is <em>Batman and Robin</em>). And the inclusion of <em>Birds of Prey</em> is very interesting. I had thought that book would be off in its own continuity, but clearly the addition of Barbara Gordon means it won’t. And also not no mention of <em>Batwoman</em>.</p>
<p>And while I enjoy a Bat-event, and would welcome one architected by Scott Snyder, I have to question the timing of this. I would have had each book build its own universe a bit more with readers before coupling them close enough for a unifying story.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thought, this seems like the perfect time to bring Cassandra Cain back to Gotham, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Last year’s final match  in the “Most Kick Ass DC Woman” tournament between Oracle and Wonder Woman was an all day battle with Oracle staging a Cinderella win to beat Wonder Woman by just 7 votes!</p>
<p>This year Barbara Gordon’s protege and successor Cass Cain took on the Amazing Amazon and again we had an incredibly close day of voting. Would another Batgirl beat Wonder Woman?</p>
<p>I’d like to thank the many people who posted about the contest in forums and the links to the voting from the <em>Mary Sue</em> and <em>the Beat</em> and in particular <em>Bleeding Cool</em>. It was much appreciated. As a result there were a lot of votes. But even after adjusting for some easily identifiable self-admitted voter fraud, the balloting showed there was an clear winner. And it was ….</p>
<p>With the removal of the 167 votes for Cass, the final tally was:</p>
<p>Wonder Woman 1167</p>
<p>Cass Cain 1192</p>
<p>Which means the 2011 Most Kick Ass DC Woman is</p>
<p><img src="tumblr_lv27u9pQIH1qbujox.jpg"></p>
<p>Cassandra Cain, the former Batgirl last seen as Black Bat.</p>
<p>Cain, after making appearances in <em>Batman, Inc</em>. and <em>Gates of Gotham</em> last year, is currently not seen in any DC books. She is reportedly appearing in Grant Morrison’s <em>Batman, Inc</em>. next year.</p>
<p>So thanks again folks for another (mostly) fun year. The fact that there is so much enthusiasm and passion for these great characters is incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>Did the reboot impact the voting? Yes, I think it did. I believe some people voted underdogs and chose not to vote for a character they ordinarily would to try express their frustration.</p>
<p>But what the main take away is that there were 32 female characters in this tournament and everyone is perceived as kick ass enough to have a level of fan support. And that is pretty damn impressive.</p>

<p>We started with 32 women and we are now down to just two.</p>
<p>Each has fought her way to the top and now just one will take the title.</p>
<p>In one corner, the woman who fights to avenge her soul and to serve the symbol of the bat</p>
<p><img src="tumblr_luzgcqHLoC1qbujox.jpg"></p>
<p>Cassandra Cain.</p>
<p>And in the other corner, the woman who wishes to bring love and peace to man’s world even if she has to kick some ass while doing it.</p>
<p><img height="229" src="tumblr_luzghaMUix1qbujox.jpg" width="306"></p>
<p>Wonder Woman</p>
<p>It all starts at 7AM EST. See you then!</p>
