      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">DC Comics has totally redesigned their web site. And it looks pretty snazzy. Here’s some of the highlights:
- They’ve finally integrated Twitter and Facebook into their site and will once again allow comments on their blog, via Facebook
- The site is divided into sections that include other media from DC Entertainment including TV, Movies, Games as well as DC Direct
- Digital comics promoted and link easy to find 
- A much easier to navigate guide to new and upcoming comics
- A guide to the most popular characters (Wonder Woman is included)
My first take is this a very nice change. Go check it out.

      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">USA Today has the preview of the latest issue of Green Arrow and it really is new as this is the first issue with the new headwriter Ann Nocenti.
If it wasn’t spelt out clearly before, it is here - this is a total reboot of the character. Nocenti states:

“It was like, ‘Hey old man Arrow, you fought a good war, now go take a break. Shed your aches and memories and go back and be a college-age kid again.’ It was a kind of karmic wipeout: Arrow was getting a chance to start over,” says Nocenti, who has teamed with new Green Arrow artist Harvey Tolibao.

I’m excited for this because 1) I had grown to dislike Green Arrow over the past few years despite liking him at one time and 2) I’ve read some, though not all, of Nocenti’s Daredevil and she is both a good writer and one that seems to be particularly well suited for the character.
Nocenti is known for imbuing her Daredevil run with social issues. How much fun will she have with Ollie Queen, clearly a member of the 1%?

“Is it possible to run a big industrial corporation in a benevolent fashion? We see these days that even the hippest companies hide some rotten practices to make their profit margins work,” Nocenti says.

Here’s the preview:

Charming.
And if you looked around you could find versions of the Darwyn Cooke costume and the Long Halloween costume or the version Michelle Pfeiffer wore in Batman Returns:

But with the arrival of The Dark Knight Rises, there may finally be a new Catwoman costume that is based on the Anne Hathaway costume. Also there are protoypes of Bats and Bane. See them after the jump.
 While these are marked protoypes they are from one the big online costume houses so I can’t imagine they won’t be ready for October. The movie costume mask also has cat ears  so I’m a little surprised not to see some cat ears as an accessory. Without them the costume doesn’t seem to very cat like.


Hmm, I wonder if they’ll be a “Miranda Tate” costume, too?</div>

      	<div class="entry_title">Some thoughts on the Earth 2 character designs and comments</div>
      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">DC was busy this past week providing some previews of the looks of some of the characters appearing in the upcoming Earth 2 books, Earth 2 by James Robinson and Worlds’ Finest by Paul Levitz this past week. And here are some of my thoughts.
First up Helena Wayne as Robin:

My take? I really like it. It’s a bit fussy in the knee pads and with all the belts and pouches, but I like the colors and I like the costume is amazingly gender neutral. I like that her hair is pull back as well. I was also intrigued by Robinson’s commentary on her:

“Helena Wayne has been taught how to be the perfect Robin,” said James Robinson, writer of EARTH 2. “Assured as a detective, fighter, scientist, pilot and all around crime-fighter she’s been groomed by Batman to be the perfect caped manhunter (or should we say manHuntress) when she grows up.”

So finally there is a girl Robin that everyone can agree is “real”, right?
On to the next costume, the Pre-PowerGirl, Supergirl:

This is marginally better than the current Supergirl outfit in that 1) she doesn’t look like she is wearing a diaper and 2) her boots don’t have cutouts for her knee. I’m not crazy about the high collar but the S logo is interesting. I am more concerned on the very different tones between Maguire’s art and Perez. More than I was when they were first announced as artists on alternative arcs.
I also like Robinson’s take on her:

“Superman’s cousin loves her adopted world with a passion, seeing how the people of Earth have adopted her and taken her to their hearts,” said EARTH 2 writer James Robinson. “She is the definitely brightest light among this first group of Earth 2 heroes.”

I am very happy with the idea of Supergirl and ultimately Supergirl being a positive character. And from the sound of what is going on in Earth 2, light is going to be at a disadvantage:

Isn’t Nicola Scott the artist on this book? Can we please see her take on Wonder Woman? Hasn’t Jim Lee had enough shots at redesigning her? Or was this just a left over design from the new 52? That said I don’t hate this. I like the skirt but I’m not sure the boots quite work. But they are flat which is something. But the costume is the least of my worries once I see what Robinson has to say about her:

“Due the events that open the saga of EARTH 2, Wonder Woman is already the last Amazon of this world and she is determined to avenge her sisters…at whatever cost,” said EARTH 2 writer James Robinson.

Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Please. More dead Amazons? How many writers have gone there? More Wonder Woman “avenging at whatever cost?” Didn’t we just have avenging alt-Wondy in Flashpoint? This makes me very, very nervous about Robinson. When he’s good, you get “The Golden Age” and Starman and when he’s not? You get Cry for Justice. 
I sincerely hope this is the former and not the latter. But I have this very uneasy feeling because of the next design:

This is better than the design they are using in the new 52 by orders of magnitude. If the new 52 high collar look is a $.50 piece this is a crispy $20. And Superman looks so young and handsome. But as nice as that costume the commentary diminishes it value:

“Mourning the death of his beloved, Superman carries both a sadness in his heart along with the weight of Earth 2′s welfare upon on his shoulders, while never showing this and seeming to all that he is this world’s peerless champion,” said EARTH 2 writer James Robinson.
“What would you have to do to teach Superman to kill?” asks EARTH 2 editor Pat McCallum. “He’s endured the loss of his home world, and now the Last Son of Krypton must weather the death of his soul mate Lois Lane. Just how far can you bend the Man of Steel before he breaks?”

Seriously, who at DC hates Lois Lane? Why are Lois and Superman only able to presented as a couple outside of the DCU in the upcoming Smallville comic and Superman Adventures, a kids book? What does that say about the value of marriage in the new 52? Hasn’t the success of Aquaman shown that a loving, committed couple CAN sell a book? Who would have thought we’d see the day when Aquaman and Mera became the poster child for happy couples in DC and Lois and Superman would be decoupled through handwaving Flashpoint rebooting nonsense and death?
I was hoping that Earth 2 would be an alternative to the very dark new 52. That it would be a respite for those who cherished some of the old DC and give them a world where they could still have some of what they thought they had lost.
But right now based on what information DC has released, it appears to be worse. At least Lois is alive in the new 52. And the Amazons have only been transformed into snakes not outright massacred.
I’ll wait and see, but I’m very nervous about this.
I want this from James Robinson’s Earth 2

And I’m afraid I might get this:

I sincerely hope I am proved wrong for that will truly be Justice!</div>

<p>“You really see Batman’s superpower is elevating the others around him.  Other than being a great tactician and a great fighter. He does know how  to motivate people in the right way and crack into them like a safe.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also Cyborg shares a connection with Darkseid via their origin and technology.And Pandora the mystery lady in purple will show up.</p>
<p>You can see the whole preview here.</p>

      	<div style="clear: both;"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">The Source has posted Jim Lee’s design for Batman in Robinson/Scott’s Earth 2, and the post clears up a few questions about who Batman is on this earth. First, for those who speculated that Batman was Dick Grayson due to the use of Escrima sticks it looks like you’re wrong because Batman is definitely Helena’s dad and definitely a “Wayne”:

“Who will Batman kill to save his own daughter?” asks EARTH 2 editor Pat  McCallum. “Right out of the gate that should tell you we’re dealing  with a different kind of Dark Knight here. More ruthless, dangerous…the  costume is familiar and yeah, there is a Wayne under the mask, but we’re  looking at a man desperate to save the only family he has left. EARTH 2  is about to become a very bad place to be a bad guy.”

So far Earth 2 sounds very grim and gritty. That said there are going to be, I believe, some nice surprises in terms of the characters on Earth 2. I don’t believe, however, that includes Wally and Donna.

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Newsarama has an interview with James Robinson about Earth 2 and it’s interesting mostly because of what he won’t say.
But there are some things worth noting:
- There’s a Wayne under the Bat-cowl but probably we won’t know who, apparently, for awhile.
- Lois is dead but “the events of her tragic death are not something that we actually will be showing, but they are something that drives Superman on in his actions in the comic book.” 
- Alan Scott, Jay Garrick and Al Pratt are all in the book. 
- As I’ve stated many times, Wally and Donna are not.
- This is a completely new Earth 2
- It’s not darker, “It’s just taken a different turn based on key events unfolding differently than on [the main DCU Earth].”
The cover of Earth 2 #2 is below. That’s Jay Garrick. And a bunch of what appears to be some kind of rats. I am increasingly concerned.

        <div style="clear: both"></div>
      	<div class="entry_summary">Cartoon Network’s DC Nation premiered yesterday morning. I sat down with my kids - an 7 year old boy and 13 year old girl - to get their opinion. One caveat, we had to tape the entire block due to their sports and other commitments. So here, after the cut for possible Young Justice spoilers is a live blog of a tape of the big event.

Me: First up is Green Lantern!
Girl: Why does he even have a show? The movie was a bomb.
Me: He’s very popular.
Girl: Then why didn’t his movie do better?
I choose not to answer.
Me to my son who is playing Legos on the floor: Don’t you want to watch this?
Boy: Okay.
Goes back to Legos
Me: Well, then watch it.
Boy: I AM
Goes back to Legos
Girl: Can we fast forward through this to Young Justice?
Me: You have no desire to watch this?
Girl: Why aren’t there any girl Lanterns?
Boy: There ARE girl lanterns. They were in the movie.
Me to boy: It seems this show isn’t interesting to you.
Boy: It’s okay. He’s okay. He’s like Buzz Lightyear.

Me: I never thought of that. You’re right!
Boy: I wish Batman was on this.
Me: Me, too.
There is an ad for Young Justice
Girl: Young Justice, Young Justice, Young Justice. (loud squealing)
Back to Green Lantern.
There are a lot of commercials.
Boy: Can, I join Wizard 101?
Me: No (This conversation is repeated several times during the block  including requests to buy an an all chocolate cereal, Pokemon cards, and something that turns bathwater into what resembles Jello).
Me: What is “Level-Up”?
Boy: It’s a really good. You should watch it. It’s about these kids and they …
Girl: The girl is cool.
Me: So you have both watched this?
Both: Yes.
Me: Hmmm.
And we finally have the first short of DC Nation:

And it is a Batman Aardman short. Batman, Robin, Joker, Superman and Catwoman. This is a huge hit. Lots of laughter.
And now it is time for … Young Justice (The squealing is at full pitch)
The boy comes to sit on the couch with us and is now fully engaged.
Girl: Zatanna is going to be a part of the team. I know it.
Boy: I don’t like that guy (referring to Klarion).

The plot involves the adults of the world being kidnapped en masse.
Boy: This is scary.
It is a little intense, actually.
The Young Justice team finds parent-less children and brings them to a school gym.
Meanwhile Billy Batson is attempting to help.

Girl: He’s a boy but he’s not Captain Marvel so they don’t know who is.
Me: Ah, thanks!
The Young Justice team of Aqualad, Wally and Robin is on television  telling the children of the world to not be afraid that there parents  have disappeared.

Girl: Why are just the boys tell them to not be afraid? Wouldn’t girls like to see a girl? I’d want to see girl.
Me: Good point.
While the boys are saying, “take of your younger siblings, there are shots of characters taking care of the children including:
Girl: Barbara and Bette (squeal)
Me: You know who might be a member of the team?
Girl: Wonder Girl?
Me: No, Batgirl.
Girl: (Squeal) Really? Really? Well, that should make YOU happy.
She knows me well.
More commercials. More requests for stuff.
Billy Batson becomes an important part of the plot as it is clear there are now two worlds - one with adults and one with children.
Girl: This is so clever - Billy is a boy and man so he can go to both worlds.
The Young Justice team have a show down with Klarion.
Girl (as Artemis takes a shot): Sick! She’s so cool.
Zatanna takes the helmet of Fate
Girl: Don’t put it on! (she does) Awesome!

It is pretty awesome.
We now go to another short. The new DC logo is full use during the block and for some reason Wonder Woman is at the front of every shot of the YJ “adults”. I am not complaining.
Time for another short — Plastic Man!

The short has Plas turning into a human sketch artist for an elderly woman who has been robbed. This doesn’t get near the reaction of the Aardman short. No laughter. The only thing that gets a reaction is a giggle when Plas turns into Shaggy from Scooby Doo.
Back to Young Justice.
Bill turns into Shazam. I make the mistake of mentioning that they have renamed the character in the comic and he will now be known as “Shazam”.
Girl: So his name is Shazam and he says, “Shazam”? Why?
Me: It’s complicated.
Boy: What does Shazam mean?
Me: it’s the initials of the Gods. Like Z for Zeus
Boy: Is he friends with the Gods? Does he play with them?
Me: No, he gets his power from the Gods.
Girl: Like Wonder Woman
Me: Right
Boy: So what do the other letters stand for.
Me: Um, okay I think it’s, um, H is Hercules and Z is Zeus, um …
Boy: Look it up on your iPad.
I pause the show.
Girl: (Getting upset) After Young Justice. After the show! You are RUINING IT.
Boy: Stop yelling at me. (Bottom lip quivers)
Me (Glaring at girl): apologize NOW!
We quickly review the the names of the Gods that make up Shazam.
Back to Young Justice.
The episode ends with Zatanna joining the team under sad circumstances.
Girl: She will be friends with Artemis. And Robin and her are both like orphans so they can be friends.
Me: Robin isn’t an orphan.
Girl: (Eyes wide) He is too. The circus?
Me: What about Batman? He’s like his father.
Girl: But he’s Batman.
I cannot argue this point.
DC Nation is over and there are previews for next week’s Green Lantern and Young Justice including “Two new DC Nation shorts” neither of which has Batgirl, Supergirl, or Wonder Girl.
Girl: Teen Titans!
Girl: Where is the one with Supergirl and Batgirl?
Me: I don’t know. I thought they would be on this week.
Girl: They must be saving them.
Me: I guess.
Me: So what did you think?
Boy: It was good! Runs back to Legos.
Girl: Young Justice is the best part. It is the best show. Artemis is the best.
What about the shorts? Did you like them?
Boy: I liked Batman talking like a little kid.
Girl: Me too.
So in summation one short and one program were hits. One short was an an “eh” and  Green Lantern has no fans here.
Also Young Justice does seem a bit intense for the younger 8 and under crowd. Klarion was frankly a little scary. I wonder if the show will be adjusted for the new Saturday morning slot?
What did you folks, think?</div>

<p>Boy: What does Shazam mean?</p>
<p>Me: it’s the initials of the Gods. Like Z for Zeus</p>
<p>Boy: Is he friends with the Gods? Does he play with them?</p>
<p>Me: No, he gets his power from the Gods.</p>
<p>Girl: Like Wonder Woman</p>
<p>Me: Right</p>
<p>Boy: So what do the other letters stand for.</p>
<p>Me: Um, okay I think it’s, um, H is Hercules and Z is Zeus, um …</p>
<p>Boy: Look it up on your iPad.</p>
<p>I pause the show.</p>
<p>Girl: (Getting upset) After Young Justice. After the show! You are RUINING IT.</p>
<p>Boy: Stop yelling at me. (Bottom lip quivers)</p>
<p>Me (Glaring at girl): apologize NOW!</p>
<p>We quickly review the the names of the Gods that make up Shazam.</p>
<p>Back to <em>Young Justice</em>.</p>
<p>The episode ends with Zatanna joining the team under sad circumstances.</p>
<p>Girl: She will be friends with Artemis. And Robin and her are both like orphans so they can be friends.</p>
<p>Me: Robin isn’t an orphan.</p>
<p>Girl: (Eyes wide) He is too. The circus?</p>
<p>Me: What about Batman? He’s like his father.</p>
<p>Girl: But he’s Batman.</p>
<p>I cannot argue this point.</p>
<p>DC Nation is over and there are previews for next week’s Green Lantern and Young Justice including “Two new DC Nation shorts” neither of which has Batgirl, Supergirl, or Wonder Girl.</p>
<p>Girl: Teen Titans!</p>
<p>Girl: Where is the one with Supergirl and Batgirl?</p>
<p>Me: I don’t know. I thought they would be on this week.</p>
<p>Girl: They must be saving them.</p>
<p>Me: I guess.</p>
<p>Me: So what did you think?</p>
<p>Boy: It was good! Runs back to Legos.</p>
<p>Girl: <em>Young Justice</em> is the best part. It is the best show. Artemis is the best.</p>
<p>What about the shorts? Did you like them?</p>
<p>Boy: I liked Batman talking like a little kid.</p>
<p>Girl: Me too.</p>
<p>So in summation one short and one program were hits. One short was an an “eh” and  <em>Green Lantern</em> has no fans here.</p>
<p>Also <em>Young Justice</em> does seem a bit intense for the younger 8 and under crowd. Klarion was frankly a little scary. I wonder if the show will be adjusted for the new Saturday morning slot?</p>
<p>What did you folks, think?</p>
